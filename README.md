Automated Real Estate Data Pipeline – Web Scraping

This project automates the process of scraping real estate property data from Magicbricks (or similar real estate platforms).
It extracts property details such as price, location, BHK, area, amenities, and more, then cleans and processes the dataset for further analysis and visualization.

Tech Stack:
Python 3.13 – core programming language
Pandas – data manipulation & cleaning
NumPy – numerical computations
Regex – extracting structured data from raw strings
Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Features:
Automated web scraping of property listings
Cleans raw data (handles missing values, price/unit conversions, etc.)
Extracts numerical values from unstructured strings (e.g., "96 Lac → 9600000")
Outputs a clean dataset ready for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and visualization
